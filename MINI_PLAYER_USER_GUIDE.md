# Mini-Player User Guide 🎬

## What is the Mini-Player?

The mini-player is a YouTube-style feature that lets you keep watching your video in a small, always-on-top window while you browse other parts of the website. No more interruptions when you want to check your favorites or search for another show!

## How to Use

### Starting the Mini-Player

1. **Start watching any video** on the site (movie, TV show, or anime)
2. **Wait for the video to load and start playing**
3. **Navigate anywhere else** - click Home, Favorites, or any other link
4. **The mini-player automatically appears!** ✨

That's it! Your video continues playing in the mini-player window.

### Mini-Player Controls

The mini-player window includes two buttons:

#### 🔙 Return to Page
Click this to go back to the full-size video page. The mini-player will close and you'll return to where you were watching.

#### ❌ Close
Click this to stop watching and close the mini-player entirely.

## Tips & Tricks

### Moving the Window
- **Drag** the mini-player window anywhere on your screen
- Position it wherever it's most convenient for you

### Resizing the Window

## Browser Support

### ✅ Works on ALL Browsers!

The mini-player now works on **every major browser**, automatically adapting to provide the best experience:

| Browser | Mini-Player Type | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| **Chrome 116+** | Separate Window | Best experience - Always-on-top window |
| **Edge 116+** | Separate Window | Best experience - Always-on-top window |
| **Firefox** | Floating Player | Good experience - Draggable in-page player |
| **Safari** | Floating Player | Good experience - Draggable in-page player |
| **Others** | Floating Player | Good experience - Draggable in-page player |

### What's the Difference?

**Separate Window** (Chrome/Edge):
- Opens in a brand new window
- Can be moved outside the browser
- Always stays on top of other windows
- Best for multitasking

**Floating Player** (Firefox/Safari):
- Stays within the browser window
- Floats over the page content
- Can be dragged to any corner
- Works great for same-window browsing

**Both modes work perfectly** - the site automatically picks the best one for your browser!

## Common Questions

### Why doesn't the mini-player appear?

Make sure:
- The video has started loading before you navigate away
- You actually navigated to a different page (scrolling on the same page won't trigger it)
- JavaScript is enabled in your browser

**The mini-player works on all browsers**, so if it's not appearing, try:
1. Wait for the video player to fully load
2. Make sure you're clicking a navigation link (not just scrolling)
3. Check browser console for any error messages

### Does the video restart when opening the mini-player?

### Can I pause/play from the mini-player?

Currently, playback controls are in the video player itself. You can interact with the video player in the mini-player window just like you would on the main page.
